For my C implementation and Mips;
I created 4 functions, that being Square Prime Number, 
Reverse Prime Num , Palindrome and Reversed root functions. 
With my first function being Square Prime Number,  
the function uses for loops to determine and generate Prime 
numbers , then an additional arithmetic expression is applied
to Square the Prime numbers before storing them in an array
 named Square Prime Num.

Then for the 2nd function  that being Reverse Prime num,
Square Prime num is recalled in this 2nd function and reverses 
all the numbers stored in the array Square Prime Num, after that
it stores the reversed numbers in another array named 
reversed Square Prime.

The following function , Palindrome, calls the previous function 
that being Reverse Prime Num, and tests if the numbers stored in array
Reverse Square Prime are Palindromes, if they are Palindromes, the numbers
 are stored in array Palindrome, if not they are stored in array non_palindrome.

Now for the last function, Reversed roots,is implemented to confirm that numbers 
stored in the array non Palindrome are reversible Square primes, these numbers are 
tested by first checking if their Square roots are Prime numbers,and
if their Prime numbers are non Palindromes. If the numbers
pass the tests ,then they are sorted in reversed roots array.

I impleneted a counter in the reversed roots function ,to count upto 10 
when displaying the reversible Square Primes which are stored in 
reversed roots array,I displayed the array using a for loop. Then 
the program is complete.
